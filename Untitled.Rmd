##Introduction to Git-Hub
1.Forking an existing Repo
  -> "Code" -> "Open in Github Desktop" -> You now should have your own lokal version of the repository
  -> you can now upload your cloned repo in your online Git-hub
2.Creating a Branch in an existing Repo
  -> "Main" -> either choose an existing branch other than the main branch, or create a new branch (preferably with a name saying what its for)
3.Creating a new file - including a model in Lavaan
  -> "Add file" or upload code from R-Studio/ Vs Code
4.Create a pull request from the branch to the main branch
  -> 
5.Collaboratively combine the different models in one model all together
6.Use Issues to communicate problems that might occure 

Look for Help at this Tutorial: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
